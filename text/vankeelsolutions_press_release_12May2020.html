<h4>VanKeel Solutions Offers Free 3D Live VTO To Independent Eyewear Vendors</h4>

<p>
VanKeel Solutions, a virtual try-on (VTO) technology startup, announced that it will globally provide independent eyewear vendors free access to its anywhere, anytime 3D live virtual eyewear try-on technology to ensure that patients of their retail clients can meet the eye health needs during this unprecedented time.
</p>

<p>
"When my brother and I decided to bootstrap VanKeel Solutions we were in the midst of the global pandemic. Starting the business in lockdown mode was a real challenge but it proved to be a fast track enabling factor to leverage of our technology stack that we had built over the many years working in the IT industry for global companies that are also operational in the eyewear industry", said co-founder Dave Vankeel.
</p>

<p>
The proprietary solution, VTOLive, developed by the company allows for a more efficient and patient or client-centric approach of the eyewear selection process. VTOLive runs on smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops. That makes it suitable to deploy in the dispensary area of the optical retail shop as well as on the website.
</p>

<p>
"We are thrilled to offer VTOLive to all independent eyewear vendors free of charge during this global pandemic, which is making it increasingly difficult for patients and consumers to select their glasses," said John Vankeel, co-founder of VanKeel Solutions. "We recognize that the limitations caused by COVID-19 have created a significant strain on the optical industry. We are confident that our technology will streamline the process for eyewear vendors, optical retailers, and patients, resulting in a greatly improved service for consumers, while keeping individuals safe."
